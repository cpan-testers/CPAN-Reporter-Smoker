NAME
    CPAN::Reporter::Smoker - Turnkey CPAN Testers smoking

VERSION
    This documentation describes version 0.01_01.

SYNOPSIS
         $ perl -MCPAN::Reporter::Smoker -e start

DESCRIPTION
    Rudimentary smoke tester for CPAN Testers, built upon CPAN::Reporter.
    Use at your own risk. It requires CPAN::Reporter 1.07_02 or higher.

    Currently, CPAN::Reporter::Smoker requires zero independent
    configuration; instead it uses configuration settings from CPAN.pm and
    CPAN::Reporter.

    Once started, it retrieves a list of distributions from the configured
    CPAN mirror and begins testing them in reverse order of upload. It will
    skip any distribution which has already had a report sent by
    CPAN::Reporter.

    Features (or bugs, depending on your point of view):

    *   No configuration needed

    *   Tests each distribution as a separate CPAN process -- each
        distribution has prerequisites like build_requires satisfied from
        scratch

    *   Continues until interrupted with CTRL-C

    Current limitations:

    *   Does not test developer/alpha versions of distributions

    *   Doesn't check skip files before handing off to CPAN to test

    *   Does not check for new distributions to test while running, only
        when starting up

    *   Does not attempt to retest distributions that had reports discarded
        because of prerequisites that could not be satisfied

HINTS
  CPAN::Mini
    Because distributions must be retrieved from a CPAN mirror, the smoker
    may cause heavy network load and will reptitively download common build
    prerequisites.

    An alternative is to use CPAN::Mini to create a local CPAN mirror and to
    point CPAN's "urllist" to the local mirror.

         $ cpan
         cpan> o conf urllist unshift file:///path/to/minicpan
         cpan> o conf commit

    However, CPAN::Reporter::Smoker needs the 01modules.index.html file,
    which CPAN::Mini does not mirror by default. Add it to a .minicpanrc
    file in your home directory to include it in your local CPAN mirror.

         also_mirror: modules/01modules.index.html

  Skip files
    CPAN::Reporter (1.07_01 or later) supports skipfiles to prevent copying
    authors on reports or from sending reports at all for certain
    distributions or authors' modules. Use these to stop sending reports if
    someone complains. See CPAN::Reporter::Config for more details.

  CPAN cache bloat
    CPAN will use a lot of scratch space to download, build and test
    modules. Use CPAN's built-in cache management configuration to let it
    purge the cache periodically if you don't want to do this manually.

         $ cpan
         cpan> o conf init build_cache scan_cache
         cpan> o conf commit

  CPAN verbosity
    Recent versions of CPAN are verbose by default, but include some lesser
    known configuration settings to minimize this for untarring
    distributions and for loading support modules. Setting the verbosity for
    these to 'none' will minimize some of the clutter to the screen as
    distributions are tested.

         $ cpan
         cpan> o conf init /verbosity/
         cpan> o conf commit

USAGE
  "start()"
    Starts smoke testing using defaults already in CPAN::Config and
    CPAN::Reporter's .cpanreporter directory. Runs until the process is
    halted with CTRL-C or otherwise killed.

ENVIRONMENT
    Automatically sets the following environment variables to true values
    while running:

    *   "AUTOMATED_TESTING" -- signal that tests are being run by an
        automated smoke testing program (i.e. don't expect interactivity)

    *   "PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT" -- accept ExtUtils::MakeMaker prompt()
        defaults

BUGS
    Please report any bugs or feature using the CPAN Request Tracker. Bugs
    can be submitted through the web interface at
    <http://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=CPAN-Reporter-Smoker>

    When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a patch
    to an existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired feature.
