# Bugs

- move SIG{INT} handler after CPAN checklock() or it gets overridden!

# High priority

- must somehow flag distros that failed due to prerequisites -- otherwise,
  each restart has to retest them, which eventually takes the full restart
  period and then the smoker never makes it past that point

    - simplest is "per-session" -- just keep distribution ID's in a %seen
      hash and skip if no history but seen
    - could make that persistent
    - particularly if persistent, would want to retest discards or skips
    
- retest discards after some period of time
    - or after failing deps are updated -- but how to discover what these are?
      would need changes to CPAN::Reporter history logging to separately
      log DISCARD with the missing dependencies
    - but halt_on_failure prevents a DISCARD message, so then what?  
      Maybe this does need to be logged via CPAN::Reporter::Smoker

# Medium priority

- if interrupted,  be more helpful
    - offer to send email to bug-Dist-Name@rt.cpan.org? (use Net::SMTP and
      CPAN::Reporter mail host?)
    - if CPAN has distroprefs, offer to auto-disable the current distro, or
      at least to open distroprefs in editor?
    
# Low/Maybe

- docs: suggest that they join cpan-testers-discuss mailing list

- create old alpha modules for minicpan and confirm they *aren't* tested
    - edit file-ls.gz

- dependencies
    - look at Module::Depends::Intrusive and CPAN::Unwind

- statistics -- show counter of tests for each test run; show total tests 
  run at the end

- logging STDERR to a file -- parameter to start()?

- add some process control -- keep a proces ID in a run file and add a stop()
  commnd to stop a running process.

- try Parse::CPAN::Meta as a way of getting dependencies?
